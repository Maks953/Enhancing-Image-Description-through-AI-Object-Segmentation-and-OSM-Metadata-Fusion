Enhancing Image Description through AI Object Segmentation and OSM Metadata Fusion

In today's time , we have plenty of images as we are living in the so called digital world now, but separating specific objects from those images or real time camera integration can
be overwhelming as there is many factors in play like shadows and other obstructing objects. 
For this project I will be investigating combining AI for segmenting automatically buildings in combination to using Open Street Map(OSM) and Metadata to provide a useful description of the images.

The goal is to use AI segmentation to automatically identify and  isolate buildings within metadata and OSM. OSM will be used to provide an integration of context rich info about buildings.
This will be a fusion of object segmentation and OSM data and will be used to accurately label buildings. There will be an additional algorithm which will be an additional algorithm which will generate meaningful descriptions of the 
buildings.

Due to ethical consideration, there will be an emphasis on privacy and ethical reasons.
